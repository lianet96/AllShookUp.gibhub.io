      <h2>John</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John is a young, nerdy boy living in the year 1956. He is a passionate lover<br>
       of music and spends most of his time listening to his favorite records. Despite being
       the only boy in his family, he has no interest in romance and prefers to focus on his
       music instead.With his thick-rimmed glasses and awkward demeanor, John is 
      often overlooked by his peers, but his love for music fuels his passion
      and creativity, making him a force to be reckoned with in the local music scene.</p>

      <h2>Rose</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose is a young woman who lives with her grandmother in a suburban
        neighborhood. She is outgoing and cheerful, but has insecurities about her red 
        hair and freckles, feeling that she doesn't meet the beauty standards of the 1950s.
        Rose has been best friends with her next door neighbor, John, since childhood, and 
        over time she has developed romantic feelings for him. However, she has never had
        the courage to tell him how she feels, and worries that he only sees her as a friend.
        Rose's mother ran off with a boyfriend and never came back, which has left her feeling 
        abandoned and longing for a deeper sense of connection with those around her.
        Despite this, Rose tries to stay positive and make the most of every day.</p>

      <h2>David</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David is a mysterious new student at school, with a handsome and intimidating 
        appearance that catches the attention of many. Despite his tough exterior, David
        has a heart of gold and genuinely wants to make friends with those around him. 
        However, his "greaser" demeanor and tough-looking exterior often lead others to
        misjudge him and keep their distance. Despite this, David remains persistent in his
        efforts to make connections with others. He has a love for vintage cars and is a talented mechanic. 
        David is a loyal friend once you earn his trust, and he always stands up for what is right.</p>
